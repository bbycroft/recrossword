A solver for the regex crossword I found \[somewhere?\] on the internet. Initially written in
Feb 2013.

It's not perfect, and only just solves the puzzle that I first found. The puzzle is worth solving
by hand first!

## To run

Run
```
    $ python3 main.py input1.rec
```
and after a bunch of logging, spits out the result in a diagram.
